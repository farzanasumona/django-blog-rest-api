<h1>Sample Blog REST API</h1>

This repository contains a sample REST API for a blog website built on Django. The API allows users to perform CRUD operations on blog posts and their respective comments. It also includes a user registration mechanism and generates a security token protocol for accessing the API endpoints.

<h2>Features</h2>

Blog Post Management: The API provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts. Users can perform CRUD operations on blog posts.

Comment Management: Users can interact with blog posts by adding comments. The API allows users to create, read, update, and delete comments associated with specific blog posts.

User Registration: The API includes a user registration mechanism, this allows users to access restricted endpoints and interact with the blog.

Security Token Protocol: To secure API endpoints, the project generates a security token protocol. Users receive a unique token upon successful registration, which they need to include in their requests to authenticate and authorize their access.

Test Cases: The project includes test cases that ensure the API functions correctly and reliably.
